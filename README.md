Welcome to my RickAndMorty Api Rest Exercise

This project is an implementation of use of https://rickandmortyapi.com API

This project contains get controller rest api method required. You can see swagger implementation once running.

In root folder exist an script shell "startApp.sh" in order to compile this SpringBoot3 project, create a Docker image
and deploy it in a docker container

Is possible run this script shell (Git Bash for Windows) and test it with Swagger index ui page

### Swagger

Docker container home page will open swagger ui home page project
